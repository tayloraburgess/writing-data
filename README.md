# Writing Data

This is a (very) work-in-progress bash tool to parse text files (containing English prose) and return some basic information: word & character count, maybe some simple grammatical analysis, etc. Writing this both for my own use and as a way to learn Node.js.

- Currently returns:
	- Character count
	- Word count
	- Frequency of an input word
