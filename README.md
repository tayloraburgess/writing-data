# Writing Data

This is a (very) work-in-progress simple command line tool to parse text files (containing English prose) and return some basic information—word & character count, maybe some simple grammatical analysis, etc. Writing this both for my own use and as a way to learn Node.js.

- Doesn’t actually run as a standalone command line tool yet…so that’s priority one
- Only pulls text from included text file—so need to add method to input file
- Currently returns:
	- Character count
